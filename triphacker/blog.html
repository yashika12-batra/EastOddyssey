      <p>Landscapes have always fascinated me!! As a nature lover and avid tree hugger nothing gives me more of a dopamine rush than standing in the middle of a humongous, glorious, lush green landscape as far as the eye can see and feeling small and insignificant in comparison to it!! As one travels and explores lands far and near, one begins to realize the extent of variety there is for such a fascination and Nature never fails to surprise!! Meghalaya is just perfect for someone seeking such indulgence!! <br> <br>

Driving out of the busy, bustling city of Guwahati was a relief; for a fast paced life with blinking lights has never been my kinda thing!! Within an hour we had driven out steadily gaining altitude as we watched the sun set below. By night we arrived at Shillong. That night and next morning we strolled around the city, which has much to offer on its own. Being an erstwhile colonial quarter of the British, the influence of Victorian architecture is visible in every nook and corner. Shillong is quaint, cozy and charming; narrow streets paved up and down the hill slopes, a laid back but physically fit populace considering the amount they walk all day. <br> <br>

The Police Bazaar has many authentic restaurants offering exotic Khasi food most of which pull down their shutters by 9:30 sharp, so better hurry to catch that dinner. For those with a belly for street food I’d recommend the stalls at the circle of Police Bazaar which are run by local families and offer a homely meal at reasonable prices. Must try out their Jadu- a local rice stewed with a variety of herbs and served with your choice of meat or vegetable curry!! Simply Delicious!!</p> </div>

      <p>The monsoon was at its rainy best, and I was on my way to a rendezvous with the clouds. But little did I know that this journey will take me to a place beyond the natural world that I knew. The road ahead led to Meghalaya, called very aptly as the ‘Abode Of The Clouds’. The destination was Shillong, a hill station of beauty, upon which many noble men have had an love affair with. And I was soon gonna be a part of this delightful list. <br> <br>

For a lot of people in Assam, Meghalaya is their favorite destination to escape the heat of the plains. Probably because it just takes a couple of hours drive on good roads to reach Shillong and beyond. It took me just 2 hours to escape Assam, and then, all of a sudden, I was around hills. Tender cold breezes made their presence felt and delicate drops from a very slow paced drizzle reassured my faith in God and nature. I felt hopeful; to see trees and not concrete, to see diversity rather than corporate monotony.</p>

      <h5>Nov 6, 2020<br>- Shreya Kathuria</h5>

      <p>My and Neil’s trip to the world’s rainiest and wettest place began in Guwahati City, from where it took us a five hour drive to reach our destination Cherrapunji. The journey crossed some splendid scenery of the Khasi Hills, which appeared astonishing green due to the summer monsoon rain. The forests, farmlands and pastures felt alive and were shining. Once nearby Cherrapunji, the scenery changes drastically. The effect of receiving the highest rainfall is clearly visible on the landscape. Eroded hills devoid of forests lie scattered. Instead, grass grows overwhelmingly everywhere and creates a backdrop that is similar to the rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands. As it was July, the busiest month for the Indian monsoon, it was no surprise that throughout our journey we encountered an endless harmony of rainfall. Though many people prefer to visit Cherrapunji in the winter months when the weather is sunny and calm, our ambition was to visit at the heart of the rainy season and experience firsthand the phenomenon of being in the rainiest place of our incredible planet in the rainiest month of the year. That’s my kind of travel and it may sometimes seem extreme, but trust me, July is magic in Cherrapunji and an experience of a life. <br> <br>

The landscape around Sohra, which is the name locals use for Cherrapunji, is truly magical. It gives the feeling of being in a place where nature is at its extreme; a dominant force that creates true wonders. The rainfall was heavy when we reached. Numerous streams could be seen everywhere, all flowing in an uncontrollable velocity and creating a deafening thunderous sound. The clouds, playing a game of hide and seek, would engulf the landscape in a beautiful whiteness, bringing down the visibility to a null. All around, there were also countless waterfalls of all shapes and sizes, some even falling right on the road. I was left at awe. We ended up finding accommodation in a delightful guesthouse. They gave us a cozy room which was perfect for the weather, or rather; it was the wet and cold weather outside that made the room appear cozier. It was almost dark by the time we finished our late lunch. Once the sun sets, there isn’t much to do in a place like Sohra. So, we spent the night conversing with the guesthouse staff over a couple of drinks of warm rum and both of us retired early to bed.</p>
